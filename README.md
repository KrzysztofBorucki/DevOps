## **About me**

I have been working in IT for 7 years, thanks to which I managed to get to know many specializations. I've been interested in DevOps for some time now. I am convinced that working in this position will bring me great joy and will allow me to further develop my career. Although this will be my beginning of my devops professional path, I already have a lot of basic knowledge that will allow me to take my first steps. In addition, I am very ambitious, I learn quickly and willingly, I infect people with my positive attitude and I always strive for the goal.
